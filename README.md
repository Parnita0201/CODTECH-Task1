# Overview of the Project

# Project : House Price prediction using Linear regression


## Objective: 
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to forecast house prices based on various features. This model helps real estate professionals and prospective buyers estimate house values with greater accuracy. The project emphasizes data visualization to reveal insights and trends in housing prices.
## Key Activities:

**Dataset Collection:**
Acquired the Boston Housing dataset, which includes features such as crime rate, zoning classifications, industry presence, average number of rooms, and more.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers. Applied feature engineering techniques, such as scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables, to prepare the data for analysis.

**Splitting the Dataset:**
Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets to build and evaluate the model. This split ensures that the model is tested on unseen data to assess its generalization performance.

**Building the Model:**
Developed a linear regression model to identify and learn the relationships between the features and house prices. This model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. These metrics provided insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the model's predictions.

**Fine-tuning the Model:**
Refined the model by experimenting with different preprocessing techniques, feature sets, and hyperparameters to enhance predictive accuracy. This step involved iterative adjustments and optimizations.

**Deployment and Prediction:**
Implemented the model for practical use, allowing for predictions of house prices based on user input data. This step involved integrating the model into a user-friendly application for real-time price forecasting.
